## Why Votify
We use Whatsapp chat groups daily, we ask many question, we answer some, but we can't make polls as we can in Messenger. Does it relate to you to get confused while choosing between either making a Messenger chat group, to benefit from the availability of polls, or making a Whatsapp chat group, to get a texting experience much better than Messenger but without polls? Now you can use Whatsapp chat groups and make polls thanks to Votify. To do so simply create a poll on Votify and share its link in the group.
